# cyfrin-advanced-foundry-dao

This project is a section of the [Cyfrin Foundry Solidity Course](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-cu?tab=readme-ov-file#advanced-foundry-section-7-foundry-dao--governance).

1. This project implements a contract controlled by a DAO.
2. Every transaction that the DAO wants to send has to be voted on.
3. ERC20 tokens are used for voting.

    _Please note: ERC20 based voting is not always recommended, and exploring other forms of governance is encouraged like reputation based or "skin-in-the-game" based. We use ERC20 for the purpose of learning._
